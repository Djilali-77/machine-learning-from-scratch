# 🧠 Machine Learning From Scratch (with NumPy)

This repository contains my implementations of core **Machine Learning algorithms** built **from scratch using Python and NumPy** — no scikit-learn!  
The goal of this project is to deeply understand how each algorithm works under the hood by implementing every step manually.

## 🚀 Algorithms Implemented

### 🟩 Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression** (Gradient Descent)
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Logistic Regression** (Binary Classification)

### 🟨 Unsupervised Learning
- **K-Means Clustering**
- **Anomaly Detection (Gaussian Model)**

### 🟥 Neural Network
- **Single Hidden Layer Neural Network**  
  Implemented with forward and backward propagation using NumPy.

## ⚙️ Technologies
- **Python 3**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)
